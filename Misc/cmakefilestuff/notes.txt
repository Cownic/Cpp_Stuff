usually the build stuff from running cmake will be store in a directory (/out/build) --> use command mkdir -p out/build
to generate the cmake files, we type cmake -S <path to source> -B <path to build>
then to run the makefile, we do a make in out/build

To run at the top level CMake File
cmake -S . -B out/build/
make -C out/build/
./out/build/TEST_1
