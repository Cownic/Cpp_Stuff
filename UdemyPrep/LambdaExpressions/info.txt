Motivation
- prior to lambda, we use function objects(STL lib) or function pointers(callback)
- often write many short functions that control algorithms
- these short functions would be encapsulated in small classes to produce functions objects
- many times the classes and functions are far removed from where they are used, leading to modification, maintenance and testing issues
- Compiler cannot effectively inline these functions for efficiency
