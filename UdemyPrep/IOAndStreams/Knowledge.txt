    Files, Stream and I/O
    - uses streams as an interface between the program and I/O
    - Independent of the actual device
    - seqeunce of bytes
    - Common header files used for IO:
        iostream -> definations for formatted IO to/from stream
        fstream -> definations for formatted IO to/from file streams
        iomanip -> defination for manipulators used to format stream IO
    - Commonly used stream classesL
        ios -> basic support for formatted/unformatted IO operations
        ifstream -> high-level input operations on file-based streams
        ofstream -> high-level output operations on file-based streams
        fstream -> provides high-level IO operations on file-based streams
        stringstream -> provides high-level IO operations on memory-based strings
