What is the STL?
- Library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions 
- Implemented using C++ templates
- Implement common data structures and algorithms

Why use STL?
- Assortment of commonly used containers
- known time and size complexity
- Reusable, Consistent, fast and type-safe
- Extensible

Elements of the STL
- Containers:
    collections of objects or primitive types
    (array, vector, stack, etc)
- Algorithms
    functions for processing seqeunces of elements from containers
    (find, max, count, sort etc)
- Iterators
    generate seqeunces of element from containers
    (forward, reverse, by value etc)

Types of Containers
- Seqeunce Containers -> maintain the order of inserted elements
    array,vectors,list,forward_list, deque
- Associative containers -> no order at all
    set, multi set, map, multi map
- Container Adapters
    stack,queue,priority queue

Types of Iterators
- Input Iterators -> from container to the program
- Output Iterators -> from the program to the container
- Forward Iterators -> navigate one item at a time in one direction
- Bi-directional Iterators -> navigate one item at a time in both direction
- Random Access Iterators -> directly access a container item

Types of Algorithm
- about 60 algorithms
- split into modifying and non-modifying

Generic Programming with Macros
- #define
- C++ preprocessor directives
- No type information, simple substituition
- Example:
    #define MAX( a , b ) (( a > b ) ? a : b)
- When we use macros, we should wrap up all our parameters with ()

Generic Programming with Function Templates
- Blueprint
- Function and class templates
- Allow plugging-in any data type
- Compiler generates the appropriate functions/class from the Blueprint
- generic programming or meta-programming
- Example:
    template <typename/class T>
    T max(T a, T b){
        return (a > b) ? a : b;
    }

    to use: max<typename>(a,b);
            max(a,b);
    - compiler can generate the appropriate function from the template and it happens at compile time
    - must make sure that the type pass in must support the the > operator for it to work

Generic Programming with Class Template
- Examples:
    template <typename T1, typename T2>
    struct My_Pair {
        T1 first;
        T2 second;
    }

    template <typename T, int N>
    class item{
        private:
            T value
            std::string name
            int size{N};
        public:
            item(){};
            item(T value, std::string name): value{value} , name{name};
    };
    to use it: item<typename> item1{a,b};
- Template Classes are typically completely contained in header files, and there is no cpp files

Containers
- Data Structure that store objects of almost any type
- each container has member functions, some specific to container
- each container has an associated header file, #include <container_type>

What type of elements can we store in containers?
- All primitives types are okay
- Elements should be copyable and assignable (copy constructor/ copy assignment)
- Moveable for efficiency (move constructor/ move assignment)
- ordered associative containers must be able to compare elements (< , ==)

Introduction to STL Iterators
- Allows abstracting an arbitrary container as a seqeunce of Elements
- They are objetcs that work like pointers by design
- Most containers classses can be traversed with iterators
- Declaring iterators: container_type::iterator_type iterator_name;
                        std::vector<int>::iterator it1;
                        std::map<std::string, std::string>::iterator it3;
                        auto it = vec.begin();
- .begin -> 1st element , .end -> location after last element
- we can treat iterators like pointers and use it

Introduction to STL Algorithms
- Works on seqeunces of container element provided to them by an iterator
- STL has many common and useful algorithms
- Many algorithms require extra information in order to do their work: Functors, Function pointers, Lambda Expressions
- #include <algorithm>
- Different containers support different types of iterators
- All STL algorithm expect iterators as arguements
- when we are using algorithms with user-defined class, we need to provide the needed overloaded operator function for some of them to work
